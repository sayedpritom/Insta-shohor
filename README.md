This is a basic social media-like website. 
1. Clicking on the love buttons in posts will mark those posts as liked ones. Then clicking on the love icon in the header will only show the ones that were liked. 
2. Clicking on the delete button(ban icon) will remove that particular item from the home page. Then clicking on the eye button on the header will only show the ones that were deleted/banned before. 
3. Clicking on the home button in the header will take the user to the home page. 
4. HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS are used in this website. Through JSON data the posts are loaded.
